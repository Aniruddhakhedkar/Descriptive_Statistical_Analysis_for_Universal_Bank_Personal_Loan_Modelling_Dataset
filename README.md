# Project Title:- Performing Descriptive Statistics with Python for an Universal Bank's Personal Loan Modelling Dataset

### Project Description:- 

This project involves conducting descriptive statistical analysis on the Bank Personal Loan Modelling dataset to gain insights into critical customer characteristics and their spending habits. The analysis focuses on measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis, interquartile range, and range).

Additionally, statistical visualization techniques are employed to visually represent important variables within the dataset. This includes the use of boxplots, scatterplots, density plots, and histograms to illustrate the distributions and relationships of key variables.

Furthermore, correlation analysis is conducted to evaluate the strength and direction of relationships among significant continuous variables.

## Tools/Software:- Python(pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn)

## Tasks/Objectives:-

1. Determination of the statistical summary for all the variables in the dataset.

2. Evaluation of the measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion for all the quantitative variables in the dataset.

3. To examine the presence of a linear relationship between age and experience variables? and create a plot to illustrate this relationship.

4. To find the most frequent family size observed for the customer.

5. What is the percentage of variation present in the ‘Income’ variable?

6. Imputation of ‘Mortgage’ variable to improve the insights.

7. Plot a density curve of the CCAvg variable for the customers who possess credit cards and make recommendations from the distribution.

8. To plot the outliers present in dataset to showcase to the stakeholders.

9. Find the decile values of the variable ‘Income’ in the dataset.

10. Calculate the IQR of all the variables which are quantitative and continuous.

11. Do the higher-income holders spend more on credit cards?

12. How many customers use online banking? Do customers using bank internet facilities have higher incomes?

13. Using the z-score of the income variable, evaluate the number of observations/IDs outside the +-3σ.
